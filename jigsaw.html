  <h1>Track Distances - Jigsaw Edition</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For this activity you will be in a group of five. Each student in a group will become an "expert" on a distance for track running. Once you have become an expert you will teach the rest of your group about your distance.
</p>

<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get into your assigned groups of five people.
</li>
<li>Each group member will be assigned a number from 1 to 3. This number corresponds with what aspect you will be teaching. </li>
<li>The table below will show what distance you are focusing on. Use the resource links to inform yourself about your topic.</li>
<li>Once you have finished reading about your topic, group with those who have the same topic as you. Use this time as an opportunity to ask questions and clarify as well as brainstorm different ways to present your topic.</li>
<li>Return to your original group; each student will present their distance to the group.</li>
<li>Once all groups are finished, the class will have a distance quiz composed of the main points from each distance</li>
</ol>
